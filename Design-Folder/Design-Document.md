# Controller Design Document 

## Target Goals For New Controller (can be changed with new ideas or remove with potential problems)
- Add flexable comfortable material to increase Ergonomics and How the controller feels in the hands
- Increase modularity with 3d printed parts (multiple parts that can be put together but all fit together perfectly
- Add Diegetic Indicators (Lights and a motor for Haptic Feedback(Rumble)

## NEW CONTROLLER Components (Driver)
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2
- 

## NEW CONTROLLER Components (Operator)

### IDEAS
- TMR electromagnetic joysticks (Better Accuracy/Percision and better battery life compared to hall effect
- 
### Gampad Tester

(Has better Circularity Control) https://www.hlplanet.com/gamepad-tester/

### Rules That Must Be Followed (FROM FIRST ROBOTICS)
- The controller must connect to the robot's control system via a wired connection, such as USB (Cannot Be Wireless)
- (Custom Controller / Custom Devices) must be produced and shown during the robot inspection per (First Robotics saftey manual 2026 And First Robotics Game Manual 2026)
